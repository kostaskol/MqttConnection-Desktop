Project 2016 Phase 2:

+ 24/12/16:
    + (+) Completed DataBaseManger (Perhaps not.
    Need to recheck)
    + (+) Created profiles for settings
    + (+) Added search results window and 
    functionality. Haven't finished pages yet 
    (how do I do that??)
        + Changed SearchResult's member variables
        to type String/Integer Property
        (useful for adding data to the TableView 
        node)

+ Plans for tomorrow (25/12/16):
    + Create search result window's pages
    + Add complete MQTT functionality
    + Perhaps (not very likely), start working 
    on offlineMode for Android
